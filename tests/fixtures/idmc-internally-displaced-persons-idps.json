Unlike refugees, internally displaced people remain under the protection of their own government, even if their reason for fleeing was similar to that of refugees. Refugees are people who have crossed an international border to find sanctuary and have been granted refugee or refugee-like status or temporary protection.", "caveats": "Please note that most of the figures are estimates. The definition highlights two issues:\n\n1) The coercive or otherwise involuntary character of movement. The definition mentions some of the most common causes of involuntary movements, such as armed conflict, violence, human rights violations and disasters. These causes have in common that they give no choice to people but to leave their homes and deprive them of the most essential protection mechanisms, such as community networks, access to services, livelihoods. Displacement severely affects the physical, socio-economic and legal safety of people and should be systematically regarded as an indicator of potential vulnerability.\n \n2) The fact that such movement takes place within national borders. Unlike refugees, who have been deprived of the protection of their state of origin, IDPs remain legally under the protection of national authorities of their country of habitual residence. IDPs should therefore enjoy the same rights as the rest of the population. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement remind national authorities and other relevant actors of their responsibility to ensure that IDPs' rights are respected and fulfilled, despite the vulnerability generated by their displacement.", "metadata_modified": "2021-05-30T22:39:32.930593", "title": "Internally displaced persons - IDPs", "tags": [{"vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1", "state": "active", "display_name": "displacement", "id": "3e3f28cd-405e-4706-a20b-74ff3e217af2", "name": "displacement"}, {"vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1", "state": "active", "display_name": "hxl", "id": "a0fbb23a-6aad-4ccc-8062-e9ef9f20e5d2", "name": "hxl"}, {"vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1", "state": "active", "display_name": "internally displaced persons - idp", "id": "d72887e4-97ee-4b5a-b3f8-2c306c3d4192", "name": "internally displaced persons - idp"}, {"vocabulary_id": "b891512e-9516-4bf5-962a-7a289772a2a1", "state": "active", "display_name": "violence and conflict", "id": "934dbae3-2b91-4c4b-9ed8-60382099dd7c", "name": "violence and conflict"}], "state": "active", "relationships_as_subject": [], "methodology": "Other", "version": null, "is_requestdata_type": false, "license_id": "cc-by-igo", "type": "dataset", "has_showcases": true, "due_date": "2022-05-30T22:39:32", "dataset_preview": "no_preview", "num_resources": 1, "dataset_source": "IDMC", "subnational": "0", "last_modified": "2021-05-30T22:39:32.801173", "groups": [{"display_name": "World", "description": "", "title": "World", "image_display_url": "", "id": "world", "name": "world"}], "creator_user_id": "196196be-6037-4488-8b71-d786adf4c081", "has_quickcharts": true, "has_geodata": false, "overdue_date": "2022-07-29T22:39:32", "total_res_downloads": 1667, "qa_completed": false, "name": "idmc-internally-displaced-persons-idps", "isopen": false, "url": null, "notes": "Internally displaced persons are defined according to the 1998 Guiding Principles (http://www.internal-displacement.org/publications/1998/ocha-guiding-principles-on-internal-displacement) as people or groups of people who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of armed conflict, or to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters and who have not crossed an international border.\n\n\"People Displaced\" refers to the number of people living in displacement as of the end of each year.\n\nContains data from IDMC's [Global Internal Displacement Database](http://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data).", "license_title": "Creative Commons Attribution for Intergovernmental Organisations", "batch": "e79247e6-a9fb-4bac-867d-7bb97b0cab4c", "updated_by_script": "HDX Scraper: IDMC (2021-05-30T22:39:31.988328)", "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/igo/legalcode", "pageviews_last_14_days": 2, "organization": {"description": "The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) is the leading source of information and analysis on internal displacement.
